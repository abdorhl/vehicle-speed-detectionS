# Vehicle Detection using OpenCV

## Overview

This Python application utilizes the power of OpenCV to perform real-time vehicle detection. The goal of the project is to detect and track vehicles in video streams or live camera feeds, providing a robust solution for various applications such as traffic monitoring, surveillance, and automated driving systems.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** The application uses OpenCV's pre-trained deep learning model to detect vehicles in real-time, allowing for quick and efficient analysis of video streams.

- **Multi-platform Compatibility:** The codebase is designed to work on different platforms, making it suitable for a variety of environments.

- **Easy Integration:** The modular design of the code allows for easy integration into existing projects or systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-detection-opencv.git
cd vehicle-detection-opencv
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
python vehicle_detection.py
```

By default, the application will use the webcam as the video source. You can easily modify the code to use a different video source or a pre-recorded video file.

## Configuration

Adjust the parameters in the `config.py` file to fine-tune the detection settings, such as confidence thresholds, model paths, and video sources.
